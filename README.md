Just trying

Removed _something file,

added the .nojekyll file

Changed mathjax

Added more stuff for mathjax

$a=\\sqrt b$

When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Added formula for markdown

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

more test

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

Using dollar signs instead of square brackets

Moved script loads to body

Added docsify LaTex
