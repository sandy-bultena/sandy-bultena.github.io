Just trying

Removed _something file,

added the .nojekyll file

Changed mathjax

Added more stuff for mathjax

$a=\sqrt b$

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Added formula for markdown

\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \]

more test

<span>\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \]</span>

Moved script loads to body
