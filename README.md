# sandy-bultena.github.io
Just trying

Removed _something file,

added the .nojekyll file

Changed mathjax

Added more stuff for mathjax

$a=\sqrt b$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Added formula for markdown

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

$$x_n = \sum_{i=1}^n {1\over i}$$

$$a_i = f(a_{i-1})$$


Added docsify LaTex

Removed Jeckyll stuff

```python
# Is this code clickable
print("hello")
```
